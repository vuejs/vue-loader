# Using Pre-Processors

In Webpack, all pre-processors need to be applied with a corresponding loader. `vue-loader` allows you to use other Webpack loaders to process a part of a Vue component. It will automatically infer the proper loaders to use from the `lang` attribute of a language block.

### CSS

For example, let's compile our `<style>` tag with SASS:

``` bash
npm install sass-loader node-sass --save-dev
```

``` html
<style lang="sass">
  /* write sass here */
</style>
```

Under the hood, the text content inside the `<style>` tag will be first compiled by `sass-loader` before being passed on for further processing.

### JavaScript

All JavaScript inside Vue components are processed by `babel-loader` by default. But you can of course change it:

``` bash
npm install coffee-loader --save-dev
```

``` html
<script lang="coffee">
  # Write coffeescript!
</script>
```

### Templates

Processing templates is a little different, because most Webpack template loaders such as `jade-loader` returns a template function instead of compiled HTML string. Instead of using `jade-loader`, we can just install the original `jade`:

``` bash
npm install jade --save-dev
```

``` html
<template lang="jade">
div
  h1 Hello world!
</template>
```

> **Important:** If you are using `vue-loader@<8.2.0`, you also need to install `template-html-loader`.

### Inline Loader Requests

You can use [Webpack loader requests](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html#introduction) in the `lang` attribute:

``` html
<style lang="sass?outputStyle=expanded">
  /* use sass here with expanded output */
</style>
```

However, note this makes your Vue component Webpack-specific and not compatible with Browserify and [vueify](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify). **If you intend to ship your Vue component as a reusable 3rd-party component, avoid using this syntax.**
