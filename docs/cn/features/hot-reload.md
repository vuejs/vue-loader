# Hot Reload

"Hot Reload" is not simply reloading the page when you edit a file. With hot reload enabled, when you edit a `*.vue` file, all instances of that component will be swapped in **without reloading the page**. It even preserves the current state of your app and these swapped components! This dramatically improves the development experience when you are tweaking the templates or styling of your components.

When scaffolding the project with `vue-cli`, Hot Reload is enabled out-of-the-box.
